Constantly plagued with a never-ending sense of wanderlust, you\'re always on the go.

While you might be pretty busy with work quite often, you\'re also super patient and able to give a pet the care and love they need.

They’re not necessarily loud or dramatic, but when it comes to standing for what’s right and wrong, they become focused on the injustice and will change the landscape, like Lavagirl from The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Lavagirl is a very quiet and gentle force, but a very powerful one.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/MUlmRFnTQxwJ2/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e476e7ea3797c5b66a7b92e945984530d91919b635e&rid=giphy.gif','Capricorns want you to know about their exotic and extravagant life.

They’re very scientific and concentrate on the knowledge and formulas that got them to where they are now. The Aquarius’ perfect superhero match is the technical Doctor Strange.','https://i.imgur.com/k41n9dp.gif','Pisces is full of energy! They like to keep to themselves, but when they need to take care of something, they’re quick to swoop in, take what they want, and quick to leave again. Because of this, the Pisces perfect superhero match is Aquaman.'),(7,'https://media0.giphy.com/media/ZD3KRRnzU8BcSdBGUk/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4754d8f3e6b83faf72e52a781f10c60f01e1b935ea&rid=giphy.gif','Your energy knows no bounds, Aries. You\'re constantly staying active, both mentally and physically, because you cannot stand to stay still for long. Wolves share this characteristic with you, always running around with the members of their pack. They\'re also known for showcasing strong leadership qualities, which is something you know all too well. If there\'s one person everyone trusts to get the job done, it\'s you. Yet you both are known for being a bit moody and aggressive whenever you don\'t get your ways.','https://media3.giphy.com/media/3oeHLfbB9kbQxfzSJa/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4731f45b3667f23e4c74d0705cc2b0c2362c1bdabb&rid=giphy.gif','You\'re certainly the most reliable sign of the zodiac, Taurus. There\'s no one anyone would rather turn to in their time of need than you. You\'re all about routine, tending to avoid change as often as possible. Bears follow a pretty strict schedule that they never stray from (what, with their hibernation patters and all), so there\'s one thing you have in common. You also like nice things, but you\'re not afraid to work for them. Bears are the same way, but moreso when it comes to finding food. If they want salmon, they\'ll get salmon.','https://media2.giphy.com/media/XbnMwZsI0KP2c5woKC/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4772f50add73672215a44a35502533b6f6a544fca6&rid=giphy.gif','You\'re most similar to a gorilla, Gemini. You\'re a gentle and affectionate human being. Same goes for gorillas, though they may not look it. You are a very social person, always curious about what others have to say or what they\'re doing. Gorillas are the same way, always communicating with those in their troop about what\'s going on or any new and exciting things one of them has learned. Gorillas are also quick learners, such as yourself.','https://i.imgur.com/EgSK10J.gif','You\'re a pretty loyal person, always there for the ones you love, but you also tend to be a bit aloof from time to time. In this way, you\'re definitely like a cat. Those closes to you mean the world to you, but you have a funny way of showing it. Cats are known for their wishy-washy personalities, tending to be pretty difficult to understand. But you do like keeping things that way, because you\'re afraid others will hurt you. After all, you\'re more sensitive than you lead on, Cancer.','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/b6/6d/59b66de588457a03923c1dc9e5cf3ad3.gif','You probably already saw this coming, but you\'re definitely a lion, Leo. These radiant creatures are known as the kings and queens of the jungle, a title you, yourself, hold in the human kingdom. Lions are constantly marveled at and regarded as some truly magnificent creatures. They love this type of admiration, and so do you. Being the center of attention is your thing, so no one else better try and steal your spotlight.','https://mitadmissions.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/goodbunny.gif','You\'re the most careful and analytical human being anyone has ever met, Virgo. Because you\'re always striving to attain perfection, you never leave anything to chance. You can be a bit critical of yourself, but that\'s only because you know what you\'re capable of. For these reasons, you\'re a lot like a rabbit. Rabbits are a much more quiet animal, who rarely ever take center stage, something you\'re not too fond of yourself. They\'re a bit misunderstood (just like yourself), especially because they\'re not as independent as a cat, but nowhere near as needy as a dog. Plus, rabbits love nature, and so do you. It brings you back to center when everything becomes too much.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/f3QMNe9NcFGjC/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47dbe5b0236051b2941a22e9219b8de6815550e019&rid=giphy.gif','Loyal and social, you\'re most definitely similar to everyone\'s best friend—a dog! You\'re a fair-minded person who just wants everyone to be happy. Without a doubt, you\'re the peacemaker of your friend group, always helping squash arguments before things get too out of hand. Just like a good ol\' pup, you can\'t stand to be alone. You need to be constantly surrounded by friends and family members or you tend to go a little stir crazy. Luckily, everyone adores you, so you\'re always in good company.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/13eyZrkNYsOWty/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47603b6f93b076a90cc10a97b891843c01a0c31f56&rid=giphy.gif','You\'re most definitely a snake, but it\'s definitely not for the reasons you\'re thinking. While you do tend to be a bit jealous and secretive, which causes you to jump to conclusions before you uncover the truth, you\'re also a brave and passionate individual. You\'re very assertive and aren\'t afraid to make your presence known, but you\'re also totally mysterious, lurking in the shadows until it\'s time for you to come out. The main reason you\'re like a snake is because you\'re ruled by Pluto, which is the planet of transformation, so you\'re always reinventing yourself. Just like a snake sheds its skin, you shed versions of yourself everyday, constantly evolving into a better person as often as possible','https://media1.giphy.com/media/W9oxbDu3wZ29i/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47d837128e65f01f294dac8c90c6464c1c92ad5756&rid=giphy.gif','Your freedom is the most important thing in the world to you, Sagittarius. Being able to do what you want when you want and how you want is something you don\'t take for granted. You\'re most similar to an owl, because they can venture virtually anywhere they want at their own leisure. You wish you had wings yourself to make traveling around the world that much easier. Owls are also known for being incredibly wise. Same goes for you. You\'re constantly trying to uncover the meaning of life, so along the way you\'ve learned interesting facts about almost everything.','https://media2.giphy.com/media/eGmab7uy95P9uYtQpe/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e4715daa4d60aaec38b5f164232f2fe10fb033ba4b2&rid=giphy.gif','Reliable and responsible, you exhibit the greatest self-control anyone has ever seen. Once you dedicate yourself to something, there is no stopping you. Just like an elephant, you forge through on your path to success. Not to mention, your family is the most important thing in the world to you. Everything you do is to ensure they have the best lives possible. If anyone ever hurts them, they better watch out. Elephants are also very protective of their families, willing to put themselves in harm\'s way if it means saving their loved ones.','https://media2.giphy.com/media/5NpxMDTLLA1QQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47e4a9e1ca09338fe2fae68e8697bbe81a6b018e27&rid=giphy.gif','When people first meet you, they tend to notice that you\'re a bit quiet. You\'re pretty shy, because you\'re not all that comfortable with new people. But once you\'re ready to open up, people see how energetic and exciting you really are. Pigs tend to be this way, too. One minute they\'ll be super mellow and the next they\'re ready to take on the world. Just like you, pigs are kind and caring creatures, always wanting to befriend other animals. They\'re pretty good listeners, too—something you\'re extremely good at.','https://media2.giphy.com/media/dvWHVxunxwimQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47ny9ezx7v7eq62nz6xvangnj1561f4l2dbnbomu0u&rid=giphy.gif','Compassionate and gentle, you\'re someone others can\'t help but adore. You always put the needs of your loved ones above your own, helping them as best you can. Because everyone loves you, it\'s obvious you\'re a dolphin. Has anyone ever said anything bad about these smiling creatures? Nope! You\'re also a water sign, so you feel at home when you\'re swimming in some body of water. Dolphins are also known for being one of the smartest animals, and you\'re one intelligent human being.'),(8,'https://media3.giphy.com/media/5jYizQflplnuiDKFll/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e477b3cd843f31d0d041e896ad29804591c04fa3a37&rid=giphy.gif','CHICAGO, USA!!!

The best city that describes the phrase ‘two sides of a coin’, Tokyo perfectly falls under the category of Gemini. As Gemini’s mind can change on a dime, so what’s a better place than the city that has just about everything and will fulfil their ever-changing needs.','https://i.gifer.com/7IFE.gif','AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS!!! The warm and caring personality of Amsterdam makes it a 100% Cancerian. The Golden Age canals lined by tilting gabled buildings whole-heartedly welcomes you to its treasure-packed museums, vintage-filled shops and hyper-creative drinking, dining and design scenes.','https://media0.giphy.com/media/l2Jea9336CmHGf2Uw/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47943efc707ee899b5be6ce1078b1a22be6ee432b4&rid=giphy.gif','HOLLYWOOD CALIFORNIA!!!

They’re social butterflies and definitely the sign most adept at handling the ‘extra-ness’ of Hollywood.','https://i.gifer.com/NGAM.gif','MOSCOW, RUSSIA!!! The old and the historic Moscow definitely will be a Virgo. Why? Well, the city’s balance between the neatness, efficiency and cultural history falls in perfect line with the characteristics of a Virgo; that is: reliable and success-oriented.','https://media0.giphy.com/media/l2JhM89nEAg7L9j7W/giphy.gif','RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL!!!

The tropical landscapes, captivating beaches and the rhythm of Rio will match the romantic and beauty-loving sign.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/TGLt7x4Ppau1oEj21v/giphy.gif','NEW YORK, NY!!! The intensity of New York can only be covered with the most passionate sign of the zodiac: Scorpio. An Epicentre for art, culture and history, NY is an irresistible feast for all while its fast-moving, unrelenting pace isn’t for everyone. Just like a Scorpio.','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/47/4a/63/474a63077177fc9b9a074d3270698b60.gif','HONOLULU, HAWAII!!!

This cosmopolitan capital city of Hawaii brings in flawless beaches, extinct volcanoes, bustling industrial districts, and a culturally rich local population.','https://i.gifer.com/Ova.gif','MONTREAL, CANADA!!!

A Fire sign, an Aries often allows anger to consume them without considering the ramifications of their actions. With so much rage and hot-headed temperament, the ability to manipulate fire helps them let off some steam - literally.\n\nThe heat surrounding Ariens is, in turn, fueled by inner fury, leaving them feeling calm once they\'ve burned out. In short: flame-on!','https://pa1.narvii.com/6606/8c76cd414d82344b3677a7cf2a84504b43419dc5_hq.gif','ATMOKINESIS!!!\nAny true Taurus can commune with nature in a way that makes other signs look positively out of touch with our world. This spiritual entanglement with Earth allows those born under the sign of the Bull to manipulate its atmosphere.\n\nTaureans have the power of atmokinesis. This means they can control the wind, precipitation, mist, and storms - they can even manipulate the winds to carry them high above the ground! ','https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BowedFragrantBats-small.gif','SHAPE-SHIFTING!!! \nGeminis are notorious for their restless spirits; they also carry with them an incredible amount of energy. Geminis are not bound by the physical confines of a single body. Their capricious nature is satisfied by an X-Men-flavored, Mystique-like ability to be anyone they want and at any time! Every particle of the Gemini body can be completely different, allowing them to shift their appearance at will.\n\nGeminis can defeat all their enemies by merely replicating their enemy\'s form, becoming an equal threat in seconds. If appearances can be deceiving, this sign takes the cake.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/VFlGlkf58p0CQFk0M5/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47d03cf45ccd3f9596f0e1f6a646d7c355ac0608bd&rid=giphy.gif','CLAIRVOYANCE AND DIVIANCE!!!\nCancers have an excellent sense of intuition. Few powers enhance this trait better than clairvoyance and divination. Cancers seem to know when things are happening in far-away places, both in space and time. Cancer\'s powerful senses can track happenings across continents and oceans, in the future or the past.\n\nIf something is happening, Cancers will know. We hope they use their knowledge wisely!','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/52/f3/70/52f37096119ca3707b77b99a11a91b18.gif','ANIMAL-MORPHING!!!\nAh, Leo, the illustrious Lion of the zodiac. What if the powerful Leo was able to represent their majesty through animorphing powers? Most would, of course, choose the \"King Of The Jungle\" to reign supreme. \n\nHowever, Leos could also turn into a glorious panther or a venomous snake, and the world will be none the wiser, perpetually at the mercy of their species-shedding abilities.

So, naturally, the Virgo power is healing. They can heal people, animals, and repair broken objects. All those hours spent worrying about a friend\'s health or that bothersome rip in their tablecloth are over.\n\nWith a little bit of focus, Virgo could be the world’s best fixer-upper.','https://data.whicdn.com/images/176429699/original.gif','TELEKINESIS!!!\nCharm, focus, and powerful energy define a Libra. Telekinesis requires an incredible amount of internal balance, and only a Libra can master this skill. Libras don\'t naturally possess this ability - they earned it through endless hours of hard work. This also means they have ultimate control over it.\n\nLibras can levitate and move objects without moving a single muscle, and with just a little bit of practice, can even learn to levitate themselves!','https://66.media.tumblr.com/da65b9ce0687bf3f4573c13a4bbff55b/tumblr_inline_o78d3v5yhX1qlak20_500.gif','MIND CONTROL!!!\nHaving trouble with the passionate possessiveness that accompanies Scorpios? Worry no longer because Scorpios\' superpower is mind control. They can cognitively possess any intelligent species and compel them to do a Scorpio\'s bidding before the person even realizes what\'s happening.  \n\nComplex and all-consuming, this power ensures Scorpios get what they want in every situation.

No matter where they are, they want to be somewhere else. Claustrophobia is their biggest fear and wanderlust is a Sagittarian obsession. Thankfully, it\'s time for these travelers to run free since they have the much-desired power to teleport. Not only can they travel around the globe in a matter of seconds, but also they can journey to the outer reaches of the universe (with proper space protection, of course).\n\nMaybe Sagittarians will even wander into a different universe - who knows? All we can do is bid a fond farewell to our dear Centaurs.','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/9b/15/9e/9b159ee8df2cba6a9b48085c335d2623.gif','INVISIBILITY!!!\nCapricorn can become invisible at will. After all, sometimes a little alone time is essential. That\'s where invisibility comes in handy: every time the world becomes too much to handle for a Capricorn, and they need to disappear for a while - they can. \n\nIn addition to this power, Capricorn\'s protective nature creates the ability to cast force-field shields around the people or objects they care about because Capricorns never leave their friends in a sticky spot.','https://i.pinimg.com/originals/27/78/6d/27786d42c876fb138b7c45e8bbd68ab2.gif','FLIGHT!!!\nAs the final Air sign of the zodiac, Aquarius has reached complete and total control over the ethereal element. They can come and go as they please by catching a breeze and lifting off from this earthly plane.\n\nIt\'s nearly impossible to tether Aquarians to the ground, so why bother? They\'ll fly away the moment you let go.','https://secureservercdn.net/45.40.145.151/523.a04.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Cover-Main.gif','ILLUSION-CASTING!!!\nPisces is the most creative of all the signs and has a penchant for the sentimental. Talent and emotional capacity allow Pisces to cast illusion spells that can penetrate the human mind and linger. This power requires an immense amount of skill and Pisces must dig deep into their emotional reserves to muster up enough energy to cast a strong illusion.\n\nWhen they learn to master their superpower, Pisceans\' illusions takes on a variety of forms that are incredibly beautiful and painfully horrific - depending on the circumstance, of course.'),(10,'https://media0.giphy.com/media/loYMBfRwwueSZBkNcQ/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47683f40673158f6b3b229f6bcc0e51ca1a14418b8&rid=giphy.gif','LAW!!! You love to win and you don\'t mind if you bruise a few egos along the way — and yes, when we say \"you\" we mean both full-fledged lawyers and Aries who have yet to pass the bar. You aren\'t afraid to go up against a formidable opponent and, when the occasion calls for it, you can verbally spar with a swiftness and an accuracy unseen elsewhere in the Zodiac.','https://media2.giphy.com/media/3o72FhGxehNdI4Ukc8/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47d06e5839c9cd4572f658a2108e917155d2e0c50b&rid=giphy.gif','ENGINEERING!!! A deliberate earth sign like yours needs a line of study that\'s firmly grounded in the real, tangible world — and entering the field of engineering will allow you to learn with your hands, through firsthand experiences. Plus, as a sign that deeply values security and comfort, we know that the buildings of the future will be in good hands (hooves?).','https://media2.giphy.com/media/26ufdITJW3PoDxhNS/giphy.gif','COMMUNICATIONS!!! With messenger planet Mercury as your ruling planet, this major recommendation might seem a little obvious, but you\'ve got the skills to back it up, Gemini. Your naturally curious, even tireless pursuit of information (okay, \"gossip\" might be a more accurate word) is a tendency that becomes a true advantage when it comes to succeeding as a journalist, writer, or PR director.','https://media3.giphy.com/media/dWKOo5eqrrZyU/giphy.gif','PSYCHOLOGY!!! Cancers get a lot of flak for being \"emotional\" and \"sensitive,\" but it\'s often the case that Crabs actually use their emotional sensitivity to understand the feelings of others. That sort of empathy makes you a great listener, one who not only nods along as someone else talks, but helps determine the next steps that person should take.','https://media1.giphy.com/media/3osxYwwh03kc8fnOBa/source.gif','THEATRE!!! The entertainment world is always looking for the next Madonna, Whitney Houston, or Charlize Theron — and it just so happens all three of those stars are Leos. You\'ve already got the confidence, magnetism, and raw star power to shoot straight to the A-list, but it won\'t hurt to have improv 101 and Stanislavski\'s \"system\" in your repertoire, too.','https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BetterImpressionableHarvestmen-small.gif','PRE-MED!!! Your connection to health and wellness is deeply rooted in your sign\'s DNA, Virgo, but it isn\'t just your association with the healing Mother Nature that makes you a natural for the med school track.

Your sign loves to view an issue from all angles, Libra. How else can you know exactly how you feel about it? Sometimes dismissed as indecisive, you actually just don\'t mind dwelling in grey areas — a rare trait, indeed. You\'ll feel right at home swapping thoughts on free will and redefining the meaning of justice with a class of fellow thinkers.','https://www.slrlounge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/white-balance-modes.gif','PHOTOGRAPHY!!! You might as well have a camera around your neck as you go through the world and keenly observe everything in it, Scorp. You have a knack for seeing the narrative in two people\'s body language and you never shy away from taking the long way home if it means seeing something new — or maybe something you were never meant to see. Time to put your unique perspective on film.','https://media4.giphy.com/media/lQPHNPMPZ7tcIwseGn/giphy.gif','EDUCATION!!! Even if you were the class clown growing up (as many Sags were), you have a professorial side that\'s ready to be freed, dear Archer. You\'re constantly inspired to pursue new academic ventures, whether on Duolingo or in a random section of your library, and there\'s nothing better than igniting that same desire in others. Getting on a track to teach the next generation that learning really is cool is the best way to do that.','https://media0.giphy.com/media/9uIvimXZf5ZK9dOOWc/giphy.gif','BUSINESS!!! A Capricorn business major? We know, groundbreaking. But when we say that you\'re made for an MBA, it\'s not because your sign fits the power suit and power stare mold of CEOs past. It\'s because you have the ambition and work ethic to top those who came before you — and with a little coaxing, we might get you to share your grand vision of a company with the rest of us.','https://thumbs.gfycat.com/EveryFrenchLangur-size_restricted.gif','ASTROPHYSICS!!! The truth is out there — and you\'re probably the one who\'s going to find it, Aquarius. Your ruling element, air, lends you an inquisitive outlook, while your ruling planet, Uranus, gives you a taste for the future and the unknown advances and discoveries that come along with it. These influences combine to create the mind of a scientist — one that might discover a new habitable solar system.','https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/334/845/90d.gif','ART HISTORY!!! As the sign of the Zodiac with possibly the most vivid imagination, you firmly believe you can only understand a person by learning how they express themselves. That\'s where your inherent attraction to art history comes in — you\'ve got the patience and creative eye needed to plumb the depths of an entire historical period\'s art canon to find the major themes and patterns therein.');
